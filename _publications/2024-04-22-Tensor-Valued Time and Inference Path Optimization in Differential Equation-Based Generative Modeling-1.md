In the field of generative modeling based on differential equations, conventional methods utilize scalar-valued time during both the training and inference phases. This work introduces, for the first time, a tensor-valued time that expands the conventional scalar-valued time into multiple dimensions. Additionally, we propose a novel path optimization problem designed to adaptively determine multidimensional inference trajectories using a predetermined differential equation solver and a fixed number of function evaluations. Our approach leverages simulation dynamics and adversarial training to optimize the inference pathway. Notably, incorporating tensor-valued time during training improves models' inference performance, even without path optimization. When the adaptive, multidimensional path derived from our optimization process is employed, further performance gains are achieved despite the fixed solver configurations. The introduction of tensor-valued time not only enhances the efficiency of models but also opens new avenues for exploration in training and inference methodologies, highlighting the potential of adaptive multidimensional paths.
