My name is Dohoon Lee, and I’m a graduate student at MARG, Seoul National University, with a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical & Electronics Engineering from Yonsei University.

My research interests focus on transportation problems, particularly path optimization for differential equation-based generative models. I am also passionate about autonomous machine intelligence, exploring how machines can reason and plan using only visual data.

Beyond academia, I have a keen interest in existentialism and continually seek answers to profound questions.

In my spare time, I produce House, EDM, and Hip-Hop music. Feel free to check out my SoundCloud link on the left!

Always open to collaborating. Feel free to contact me!
